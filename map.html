                    built on reclaimed land in the Charles River basin. Construction began in 1859, 
                    as the demand for luxury housing exceeded the availability in the city at the time,
                    and the area was fully built by around 1900.[3] It is most famous for its rows of Victorian
                     brownstone homes—considered one of the best preserved examples of 19th-century urban design in the 
                     United States—as well as numerous architecturally significant individual buildings, and cultural institutions 
                     such as the Boston Public Library. Initially conceived as a residential-only area, commercial buildings 
                     were permitted from around 1890, and Back Bay now features many office buildings, 
                     including the John Hancock Tower, Boston's tallest skyscraper.It is also considered a fashionable shopping destination 
                     (especially Newbury and Boylston Streets, and the adjacent Prudential Center and Copley Place malls) and home to several major hotels</p>

                    commonly referred to as East Fenway/Symphony and West Fenway.</p>

                     lies the South End neighborhood; to the southeast of the Pike and Tremont Street is the southern edge of Chinatown. 
                     To the west of Berkeley Street and north of Columbus Avenue (west of Arlington Street) is the Back Bay neighborhood.
